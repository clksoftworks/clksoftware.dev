This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`c3`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> __Note:__ while the `dev` script is optimal for local development you should preview your Pages application as well (periodically or before deployments) in order to make sure that it can properly work in the Pages environment (for more details see the [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages` recommended workflow](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/blob/05b6256/internal-packages/next-dev/README.md#recommended-workflow))
